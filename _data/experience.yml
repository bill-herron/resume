    <h4>Transaction Response Formats</h4>
        <p><span>Each transaction response contains an HTTP status code, along with a JSON response body, or a JSON error body. HTTP status of 200 is always associated with a JSON response body, an HTTP non-200 is associated with a JSON error body.</p>
        <h2>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</h2>
        <p>This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">W3C specification</a>, allowing cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.</p>
        <h2>Authentication</h2>
        <p>Certegy CashLine supports two forms of authentication:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Basic Authentication (basicAuth)</li>
        <li>Bearer Key Authentication (bearerAuth)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Basic Authentication</strong> is used for "/user/login" and "/user/{merchantID}/login" transactions, validating the user's credentials and allowing a Java Web Token (JWT) "bearer" token to be returned and used in subsequent requests. Transactions run directly from a browser (e.g., "/docs/apidoc") require Basic Authentication but do not respond with nor utilize bearer tokens.<br /><br /><strong>Bearer Key Authentication</strong> uses bearer authentication (also called token authentication) which is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a logon request. It has an expiration date of 60 minutes, after which the token expires and a new token needs to be generated and presented (do another logon).</p>

        <h2><br />Idempotent Requests</h2>
        <p>This API supports idempotent requests (requests which when sent again produce the same results).<br /><br /> Requests for which idempotency is required should use a customer-supplied unique reference number (trxID) in the request body. If an API call is for some reason disrupted and you do not receive a response, sending the transaction again with the same trxID will guarantee that only one transaction is processed and that a charge is not duplicated. You can create the unique keys any way you want, but something like V4 UUIDs will work, or any other random key that serves to avoid collisions.<br /><br /> The trxID will expire after 24 hours, so a new response will be generated if a key is reused outside of that time frame. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and generates an error if the transaction details do not match.</p>
        <p>All POST and PUT requests accept the trxID parameter (either in the path or in the request body). Sending the trxID parameter in GET and DELETE requests has no effect and should be avoided, as these requests are idempotent by definition.</p>
        <h2>Getting Assistance</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this API or how to use it, please contact your sales representative or email <a href="mailto:apisupport@certegy.com">Certegy API Support</a>. Emails will be answered within one business day.</p>
